//! A thread-safe intrusive linked list with loan semantics.
//!
//! This module provides [`LoanList`], a specialized linked list data structure
//! with two key properties:
//!
//! 1. **Pinned, intrusive entries**: List entries are allocated once by the
//!    caller (potentially on the stack) and must remain pinned. Entries can be
//!    freely inserted and removed without reallocation.
//!
//! 2. **Loan semantics**: Entries can be removed from the list by a third party
//!    (not the owner) via [`LoanList::extract_if`]. The remover gets temporary
//!    shared access to the entry (a "loan"), and if the owner tries to remove
//!    the entry concurrently, they will block until the loan completes.
//!
//! This design is particularly useful for managing wait queues.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let litebox = LiteBox::new(platform);
//! let list = LoanList::new(&litebox);
//!
//! let mut entry = core::pin::pin!(LoanListEntry::new(platform, 42));
//! entry.as_mut().insert(&list);
//!
//! // Another thread can remove and examine the entry:
//! for removed_entry in list.drain(|&value| {
//!     if value == 42 { DrainAction::Remove } else { DrainAction::Keep }
//! }) {
//!     println!("Removed: {}", *removed_entry);
//! }
//! ```
