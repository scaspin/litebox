//! Session and instance management for OP-TEE TAs.
//!
//! This module handles the lifecycle of TA sessions and instances:
//! - Session tracking (session_id → instance mapping)
//! - Single-instance TA caching (uuid → instance)
//! - Instance lifecycle (load, run, cleanup)
//!
//! ## Concurrency Model
//!
//! TA execution is serialized externally; [`TaInstance`] is shared without
//! an inner mutex. The exclusivity invariant lives in [`SessionManager`]
//! and is acquired through an internal RAII `SessionToken` that bundles
//! whichever locks the current operation requires — see `SessionToken`'s
//! doc for the per-case breakdown.
//!
//! Both [`SessionManager::with_ta`] (OpenSession) and
//! [`SessionManager::with_session`] (Invoke/Close) acquire the token
//! non-blockingly, run the caller's closure under it, and release on
//! return. On contention they return `EThreadLimit`.
//!
//! ### Difference from OP-TEE OS
//!
//! OP-TEE OS uses RPC-based waiting: when a TA is busy, it returns to normal world
//! via `mutex_lock()` issuing an RPC, allowing the Linux kernel to schedule other
//! work while waiting. This is efficient but fundamentally insecure because normal
//! world is untrusted.
//!
//! ### LiteBox Behavior
//!
//! We return `OPTEE_SMC_RETURN_ETHREAD_LIMIT` at the SMC level instead of RPC-waiting.
//! The Linux OP-TEE driver handles this by:
//! 1. Adding the caller to a wait queue (`optee_cq_wait_for_completion`)
//! 2. Sleeping until another call completes (`optee_cq_wait_final` wakes waiters)
//! 3. Automatically retrying the SMC
//!
//! This provides transparent retry behavior for client applications while keeping
//! the waiting logic in normal world (where scheduling is appropriate), without
//! requiring RPCs that would give untrusted code control over secure world execution.
//!
//! Panic cleanup paths flip all sessions for the failed instance to `Dead`
//! and evict the matching cached instance via
//! [`SessionManager::mark_sessions_dead_for_instance`].
//!
//! Reference: <https://optee.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture/trusted_applications.html#multi-session>
//!
//! ## OP-TEE OS Thread IDs and RPC
//!
//! In OP-TEE OS, **session IDs** and **thread IDs** serve different purposes:
//!
//! ### Session IDs
//!
//! - Allocated by secure world, globally unique at any point in time
//! - Stored in `msg_arg.session` and returned to normal world on `OpenSession`
//! - Used by `InvokeCommand` and `CloseSession` to look up the target session
//! - Multiple sessions (with different IDs) can share the same TA instance
//!
//! ### Thread IDs
//!
//! - Logical indices into OP-TEE's global `threads[]` array
//! - Identify the execution context (thread) handling a request
//! - **Stable across core migrations**: a thread keeps its ID even if rescheduled to another CPU
//!
//! ### Thread IDs and RPC Resume
//!
//! When a secure thread suspends for RPC (e.g., to request file I/O from normal world),
//! OP-TEE returns the **thread ID** to normal world via SMC registers:
//!
//! - ARM64: `a3` contains "Thread ID when returning from RPC"
//! - Registers `a3-a7` are "resume information"—opaque to normal world, passed back unchanged
//!
//! Normal world calls `OPTEE_SMC_CALL_RETURN_FROM_RPC` with these registers intact.
//! OP-TEE uses `thread_resume_from_rpc(thread_id, ...)` to resume the correct thread.
//!
//! **Note**: `a3-a7` are opaque from normal world's view—secure world can store anything
//! (thread ID, encrypted token, pointer, etc.). OP-TEE uses thread ID, but the protocol
//! just requires normal world to preserve and return them.
//!
//! ### Security Consideration
//!
//! Normal world is **untrusted** but expected to preserve `a3-a7` and pass them back correctly.
//! There's no enforcement—normal world could tamper, delay, or corrupt resume information.
//! OP-TEE OS validates thread IDs but fundamentally trusts normal world to cooperate.
//!
//! ### Key Distinction
//!
//! - **Session ID**: lookup key for `InvokeCommand`
//! - **Thread ID**: identifies suspended thread for RPC resume
//!
//! In OP-TEE OS, multiple threads can have pending operations on a session, but only one
//! **executes** at a time—others wait via RPC (suspended in normal world).
//!
//! ### LiteBox Status (TODO)
//!
//! - We return `ETHREAD_LIMIT` instead of RPC-based waiting
//! - RPC needed for secure storage—will require:
//!   - Saving CPU context (registers, stack, etc.) when suspending for RPC
//!   - Indexing saved contexts by an identifier (passed via `a3-a7`)
//!   - Restoring context when normal world calls `RETURN_FROM_RPC`
//!   - Encrypting the resume identifier (thread ID, etc.) with authenticated encryption
//!     (e.g., AES-GCM) to detect tampering and replay attacks from normal world
